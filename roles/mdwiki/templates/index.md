Hello, it's [me][adele]
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet  
To go over everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  

> Hello, can you hear me?  
> I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
> When we were younger and free  
> I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  

There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
**Hello from the other side**  
I must've called a thousand times  
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done  
But when I call, you never seem to be home  
*Hello from the outside*
